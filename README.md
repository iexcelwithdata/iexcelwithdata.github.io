## 📊 About This Portfolio
This portfolio showcases my work at the intersection of **data analytics** and **energy market intelligence**.  
It highlights how I apply analytical methods to turn complex datasets into **clear, actionable insights** that support decision-making in the **renewable energy and power markets**.

My focus areas include:

- Data visualization and storytelling for executive dashboards  
- Energy market forecasting and scenario modeling  
- Data modeling and transformation (Power Query, DAX, SQL)  
- Translating data into strategy and alignment across teams  

> 💬 *“Everyone talks about moving fast, but speed means nothing without alignment.  
> And you can’t align on gut feeling — you need data.”*
